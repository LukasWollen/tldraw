# AI Whiteboard Prototype

This is a scaffold project integrating [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev) with an AI assistant using the OpenAI GPT‑4.1 API. It uses React 18, Vite, and TypeScript.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite dev server and API proxy
- `npm run build` – build the client

Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` with your `OPENAI_API_KEY` before running.
